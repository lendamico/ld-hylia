title: The Design Studio Method for Product Owners

---
In a [hands-on, interactive session](https://www.meetup.com/ProductTank-Philadelphia/events/240453975/) for [Product Tank Philadelphia](https://www.meetup.com/ProductTank-Philadelphia), I shared some basic principles of the design studio method, including how product managers can use the design studio method to rapidly generate ideas for their own digital products. I also facilitated a mini design studio challenge focused on building practical skills that attendees could use right away to build better digital products.
