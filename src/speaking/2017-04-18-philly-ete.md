title: "Itâ€™s All in the Questions You Ask: Design Thinking 101"
---

I was lucky enough to share the stage with the incredible [Natalie Nixon](http://figure8thinking.com/about/) for this talk at [Philly ETE 2017](http://2017.phillyemergingtech.com/session/its-all-in-the-questions-you-ask-design-thinking-101/). Natalie gave the engineer-heavy audience an overview of Design Thinking, while I ran through a brief Design Studio exercise to help reinforce some of the concepts.

>Why has design thinking become such a popular topic and methodology in the past 5-10 years? From Harvard Business Review, to public school education and from the Silicon Valley to the White House, more people are incorporating this problem solving method into their strategy work. In this interactive session, Len and Natalie shared basic principles of design thinking and then facilitated a mini design challenge left attendees with practical skills to apply to their work.
