title: Democratizing Design with the Design Studio Method
---

<!--more-->

> Designers can't "own" UX; rather, they must empower product managers and engineers be part of it. UX can't just be a department; UX must be embedded in the culture of your organization. In this talk, I shared some of the methodologies we use to democratize design at Arcweb, and how you can use them to make better digital products.

I spoke at [Tech2gether](http://tech2gether.org) about how Arcweb uses the Design Studio method to democratize our design process.[Tony Abraham](http://tonyabraham.com) of [Technical.ly Delaware](http://technical.ly/delaware/) provided [a great write-up](http://technical.ly/delaware/2015/11/20/heres-firms-consider-democratizing-design-process/) of my talk.

I expanded many of the concepts in my talk into a [blog post](/journal/democratizing-design-with-the-design-studio-method/).
