title: Introducing Roar Lions Roar

> Onward State, Onward State, <br/>
Roar, Lions, Roar!<br/>
We'll hit that line, roll up the score, <br/>
Fight on to victory evermore, <br/>
Fight on, on, on, on, on! <br/>

So a bunch of luminaries from the Penn State blogosphere and #PSUtwitter got the itch and decided to start a new blog. For some reason, they let me tag along.

I couldn't be more excited to share [Roar Lions Roar](http://roarlionsroar.com) with you.

I'll be writing some, but mostly overseeing the tech and design of the site. My job will be really easy, thanks to the platform that the guys at [Eleven Warriors](http://elevenwarriors.com) are sharing with us, and the designs that the incredibly talented Sean Baker of [Superboss](http://superboss.co) has contributed.

Here's my first piece for the site: a preview of the [insanely talented and deep wide receiving corps](http://www.roarlionsroar.com/penn-state-football/2016-football-preview/2016/08/74/rlr-position-preview-wide-reciever).

Go check the site, sign up for a [free account](http://www.roarlionsroar.com/user/register), and [cop a shirt](https://store.roarlionsroar.com).

This is gonna be fun.
