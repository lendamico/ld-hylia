*Look* at it. It is perfect.

![Marko staring longingly at his missing daughter's doll.](/images/posts/saga25-marko.jpg 'A perfect panel.')

It's from [Saga #25](https://www.comixology.com/Saga-25/digital-comic/191648?ref=c2l0ZS9saXN0L2Rlc2t0b3AvZ3JpZExpc3QvSXNzdWVz), which is my favorite comic book in the world right now.

It's the look of a father, estranged from his toddler daughter, who is not sure where his daughter is, when he might see her again, or whether she and her mother are in immediate danger. But I didn't need to tell you any of that, becasue you can see all of that, and more, in Marko's eyes.

It's all right there. *This panel* is what makes Saga transcendent.
