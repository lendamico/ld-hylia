Ben Gibbard's been doing the rounds to promote Death Cab for Cutie's quite good new record, [Thank You For Today](https://open.spotify.com/album/6agCM9GJcebduMddgFmgsO?si=JZ3I54gGR7y6LKaNJcmTqg).

Gibbard was asked to [force-rank all eight Death Cab albums](https://noisey.vice.com/en_us/article/9kmzp8/rank-your-records-death-cab-for-cutie-ben-gibbard), and his answers were [somewhat controversial](https://news.avclub.com/ben-gibbard-incorrectly-ranks-the-best-death-cab-albums-1828253300) (_The Photo Album_ is way too low for my liking). However, it's [this interview with Entertainment Weekly](https://ew.com/music/2018/08/14/ben-gibbard-death-cab-thank-you-for-today-interview/) that stuck with me.

EW asks Gibbard about the 15-year anniversaries of both _Transatlanticism_ and _Give Up_. His answer is very illuminating, and incredibly self-aware:

> When I look back at 2003, it was the best year I’ve ever had creatively: having _Transatlanctism_ and _Give Up_ come out in the course of six months. I’ll never have another year like that.

I can't imagine how difficult it is to admit that your best creative work occurred fifteen years ago as a working recording artist, promoting a new release with major label backing.
