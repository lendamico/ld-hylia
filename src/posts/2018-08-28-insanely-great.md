Listening to the audiobook version of [Insanely Simple](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13383957-insanely-simple) and the author tells a story about Steve Jobs proudly demoing a "with special offers" version of OS 9 that would ship with a 60-second startup commercial, along with other ads throughout the OS.

I'm going to maybe spend the rest of the day thinking about this alternate timeline.
