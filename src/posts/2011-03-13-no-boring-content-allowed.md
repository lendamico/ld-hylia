title: No Boring Content Allowed (SxSW)

Writer and content strategist&nbsp;[Stephanie Hay](http://stephaniehay.com) on writing compelling content. A (very old) version of LenDamico.com is cited on slide 20.

> A POSITIVE EXAMPLE: Len Damico. I know what he does BEYOND just “design websites,” clearly and thanks to his use of active voice, plus what he wants *me*&nbsp;to do. He exudes conﬁdence, humble-ness, and demonstrates that he THINKS about the different facets of a successful design -- not just the skill sets required.

The fact that she just gave this talk at [SxSW](http://schedule.sxsw.com/events/event_IAP5783) makes me a little tingly. Thanks, Stephanie! Glad you enjoyed it! And thanks, too, to Courtney from [M](http://agency-m.com) for [pointing it out](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10100700507309624&amp;set=a.10100592418984494.3418232.9347510)!
