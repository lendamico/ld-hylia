Soundgarden was never my "favorite band."

I was always a Pearl Jam guy, at least in high school. Others were Nirvana People, or Nine Inch Nails People. But Soundgarden was always a band that was just **there**. Always on the periphery, always high quality, but never The Band That Could Be Your Life.

I never stood in line for Soundgarden tickets. I never went to a midnight sale for a new Soundgarden CD release. I never bought a magazine just for the Chris Cornell interview like I did for Eddie Vedder, Billy Corgan, or Thom Yorke. There was no obvious outward showing of love, or fandom.

Which makes my reaction to the news of Chris Cornell's passing feel… not quite fake, but perhaps not earned? Inauthentic? I'll probably cry when Vedder dies. I'll take a week off work when the first member of R.E.M. goes. But Cornell? I've been trying not to dive too deep into my feelings about it, to be honest, because I'm not quite sure what I'll find.

And yet… I still remember the take-my-breath-away feeling of hearing "Hunger Strike" for the first time. It's still just as arresting to this day. Cornell and Vedder sound like they'd been bandmates for a decade or more… yet they'd only met for the first time [during the Temple of The Dog sessions](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/temple-of-the-dog-an-oral-history-w442502).

I still remember the countless hours spent alone in my room, playing "Seasons" on repeat, trying to figure out what the hell open tuning it was written in, never mind how to play it. (I learned today that it's `FFCCcc`, because of course it is.)

And it's impossible not to think of the Summer of 1994 without thinking of "Black Hole Sun" and it's subversively trippy video.

"Black Hole Sun" is by no means a great Soundgarden song. It's not even the best song on Side A of the Superunknown tape. But that shit was ubiquitous, friends. You couldn't turn on MTV without seeing that creepy, melty-face girl grinning sadistically at you. It was everywhere, always, woven into the fabric of that time.

And maybe that's what's so jarring about the fact that he's gone. Cornell's music was an institution, one I thought we could count on for another few solid decades of reunions with Soundgarden, occasional solo records and sporadic other projects. But nothing lasts forever, and the seasons roll on by.
