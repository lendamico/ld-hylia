Yâ€™know how the YouTube algorithm is [an awful garbage fire](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/11/18220379/youtube-creator-burnout-elle-mills-algorithm) but sometimes it serves you a gem that feels like a piece of yourself in a time capsule? That's what this video is for me.

The band *may* have spent a combined $27 on their wardrobe for their big MTV debut. This isn't even an early-90s post-grunge thrift store vibe; this is TJ Maxx proto-normcore and it *speaks* to me.

Nate Mendel looks like he put down his bass after filming this and hopped in the minivan to pick up the kids from soccer practice.

My wrists hurt from watching William Goldsmith pound those drums so expertly.

And the interplay between Dan Hoerner and Jeremey Enigk's guitars and voice is often too much to bear for me.

I *worshiped* Sunny Day Real Estate. I loved this band so much. So, so much.
