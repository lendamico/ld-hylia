title: Paint this picture in my mind, my masterpiece
---

It's been a while since a song grabbed me out of nowhere and refused to let go. But that happened last week, about 15 feet from my desk at Arcweb, no less.

REC Philly turned my office into a concert space, and brought the incredible [Max Swan](https://www.instagram.com/maxwell_swan/) to perform as part of their inaugural Tech Tour event. (Earlier in the day, I was [part of a panel](http://lendami.co/speaking/2018-09-28/tech-tour/) discussing data.)

Max's whole set, clocking in just under an hour, was something to behold. But it was the closer, "Steady," that made me drop what I was doing and pay attention.

I saved his most recent album, [The Fisherman](https://open.spotify.com/album/0v6Fl7UmL85nApe2hwTnzI?si=IGzTDRIdSL6gC_EQ6Sg67A) to my phone to listen to on the drive home. While the live version of "Steady" is propulsive, the recorded version is much more patient, leading with a very "Songs In The Key Of Life"-era Stevie Wonder vibe.

Either way, I'm honored to have shared a "stage" with Max and his band, and can't wait to hear what they do next.
