I wrote about 50 lines of the jankiest JavaScript you'll ever see last night. The code would be slaughtered in seconds on Stack Overflow. I probably could have done what I needed to do in about 10 lines if I planned it out and thought it through. But none of that matters for now. Know why?

*Because it worked.*

Sometimes it's so easy to worry about finding the most elegant or efficient solution to a coding problem. There's almost a Zen-like feeling of peace achieved when functions and arguments are stripped away, leaving you with script that's as tight as a drum. [Code Golf](http://codegolf.com)-worthy, even. And that's great. Especially if you're operating at scale.

But don't let the paralysis of planning take over before you even get a working version of your code. You can always strip things out later, but you can never feel the joy of hitting command-R and seeing an animation ease in perfectly unless you dive right in and make a mess.
