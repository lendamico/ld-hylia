About 8 years ago, we received a coffee grinder as a Christmas gift. It was a very thoughtful gift, because my wife and I both love coffee. Except that after a pretty short while, it became a hassle. Grinding beans is just another step in the morning, I don't notice much if any taste difference, and it's almost impossible to make a cup in the morning with my son asleep.

Yet still, we bought bag after bag of whole bean coffee. Because we had a grinder, and we couldn't let that go to waste, y'know?

Finally, I had a Moment of Clarity on the subject. I realized that this was silly, and that we should just buy ground coffee, and that we should ignore the "sunk cost" of already having a grinder. I felt enlightened as I went to grind beans for presumably the last time this morning.

The coffee grinder was dead.
