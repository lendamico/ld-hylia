It’s remarkable how quickly Hop Along’s “Bark Your Head Off, Dog” moved along this progression:

* I like it, but I maybe liked their last jawn better
* wait, holy shit, this is great
* this is definitely one of the year’s best records
* telling everyone I know how great this band and record are
* this is definitely one of the decade’s best records
* this record has become my new Emotional Center, my safe harbor
